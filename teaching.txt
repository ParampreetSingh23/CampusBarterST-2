Hey! 👋 Welcome to your friend's coding project.

This is a step-by-step guide to help you run this website on your own computer. Don't worry if you've never done this before—verify it's simpler than it looks!

We are going to do three main things:
1. Install the tools you need.
2. Download the "parts" (dependencies) for the website.
3. Turn on the engine (start the server).

---

### Step 1: Install the Tools 🛠️

You need two free programs to run this:

1. **Node.js**: This is the engine that runs the code.
   - Go to: https://nodejs.org/
   - Download the **LTS** version (Left button, usually recommends for most users).
   - Install it just like any other program (Next, Next, Finish).

2. **VS Code** (Optional but recommended): A text editor to view the code.
   - Go to: https://code.visualstudio.com/
   - Download and install it.

---

### Step 2: Open the Project 📂

1. If you received this as a ZIP file, **unzip/extract** it first.
2. Open **VS Code**.
3. Click **File** > **Open Folder...** (or Open on Mac).
4. Select this project folder (`CampusBarterWeb-2`).

Now you should see all the files on the left side of the screen.

---

### Step 3: The Command Center (Terminal) 💻

We need to type some commands to tell the computer what to do.

1. In VS Code, look at the top menu bar.
2. Click **Terminal** > **New Terminal**.
3. A panel will open at the bottom. This is where you type commands.

---

### Step 4: Install Dependencies 📦

Think of this like a LEGO set. You have the instruction manual (the code), but you need the actual bricks. This command fetches all the bricks.

1. Click inside the Terminal panel at the bottom.
2. Type this exactly and press **Enter**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. You will see a lot of text scrolling and loading bars. Wait for it to finish. It's done when it lets you type again.

### Step 5: Check the Keys 🔑 (.env)

This project uses a database and other services that need secret passwords. These are stored in a file called `.env`.

1. Look at the file list on the left.
2. Check if you see a file named `.env`.
3. **If it's there**: Great! You are ready.
4. **If it's NOT there**:
   - Ask your friend to send you the content for the `.env` file.
   - Right-click in the file list > New File.
   - Name it `.env`
   - Paste the secrets they gave you inside and save (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S).

   *Note: It usually looks like `DATABASE_URL=postgres://...`*

---

### Step 6: Start the Engine! 🚀

Now we run the website.

1. In the Terminal, type this command and press **Enter**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. You should see text saying the server started, likely on **port 5001**.

---

### Step 7: See it in Action 🌐

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.).
2. In the address bar, type:
   
   http://localhost:5001

3. Press Enter. You should see the website! 🎉

### Quick Tips 💡

- **To Stop**: Click in the terminal and press `Ctrl + C` to stop the server.
- **Errors?**: If you see red text, read it carefully. Usually, it means a file is missing (like `.env`) or something is already running on that port.

Good luck! You're basically a hacker now. 😎
